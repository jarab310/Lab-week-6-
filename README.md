##How to Contribute

This code is admittedly really boring and uninteresting. 
I mean, it just takes two things you type and puts them in a bland sentence that is always the same except for the inputs.
If you want to contribute you could maybe make the sentence change based on how high or low the age input is or something simple like that.
You could also just suggest changes if you aren't sure of your coding skills but have an idea you want to see.
We are open to most changes but if you want to make sure that your change is acceptable you can check the CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md.
