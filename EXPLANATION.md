## Explanation ##

I chose the license from OpenSource.org because I thought it captured the general idea of what a license should be. Basically saying that people are allowed to contribute but we hold the rights to the original product on GitHub.

I chose the Code of Conduct from CocoaPods on GitHub because their project is simliar to ours in that it is A. on git hub and B. able to be changed and contibuted to by community members. I believe it captured the essence of this project and it was well written.
